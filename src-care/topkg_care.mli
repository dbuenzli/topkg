(** Topkg package care.

    Tools to help the package developer in the life cycle of the
    package. Most of these tools can be invoked directly from the
    command line via the [topkg] binary installed by the [topkg-care]
    package.

    {b WARNING.} Do not use this API in your package description file, use
    only {!Topkg}. This API was not thoroughly designed, is not stable and
    may change even between minor versions of [topkg]. Use at your own
    risk.
